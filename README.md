# Project-3--Pair-19
Gerson Hernandez
I will be parsing the log file and reading them to deferentiate the servers, activities, date and time, and email IDs.They will go into their own sub categories and save into a whole new text file that only shows servers or activities or date and time. I have to give it more thought after rewatching the lectures and looking online what is the best way to approach this project.
